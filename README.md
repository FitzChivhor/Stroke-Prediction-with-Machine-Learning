Stroke Prediction with Machine Learning: Optimizing Care and Prevention

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and development of a machine learning model for predicting the occurrence of strokes in patients. The primary objective of this project is to create an accurate and interpretable model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at high risk of stroke, enabling timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.

Key Features
- Thorough exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between various health indicators and stroke occurrence
- Evaluation of multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
- Implementation of SMOTE sampling technique to address class imbalance and improve model performance
- Rigorous hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian search to fine-tune the models
- Detailed comparison of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Identification of the most informative features for stroke prediction through feature selection techniques
- Recommendations for further enhancements, including collecting additional relevant features, exploring feature interactions, and validating the model on external data
  
Results

After extensive analysis and optimization, the Random Forest model with SMOTE sampling emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an impressive F1-score of 0.9901. This model demonstrates a strong ability to predict stroke occurrence while maintaining high accuracy and explainability.

Impact
The stroke prediction model developed in this project has the potential to significantly improve patient care and outcomes by enabling healthcare professionals to identify high-risk patients and implement preventive measures. By integrating this model into clinical decision-making processes, healthcare providers can optimize resource allocation, personalize treatment plans, and ultimately reduce the incidence and severity of strokes.

Future Directions
To further enhance the model's performance and usability, we recommend collecting additional relevant clinical data, exploring feature interactions, validating the model on external datasets, and developing a user-friendly interface for seamless integration into clinical workflows.
